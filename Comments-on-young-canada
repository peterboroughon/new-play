This file will contain some comments on the play "Young Canada".. 

Young Canada is named after a painting of the late nineteenth century 
which depicts children leaving school at the the end of the day. 

Some of the music in the play is taken from a book of three part songs published in 
1869 for the Ontario school system, and other pieces are my own original work. The 
opening scene has the adults singing a  sentimental song from the 1869 book that 
speaks of the happy children coming home from school. The children sing a rather 
more cynical song of my composing in which they bless the school bell that sets 
them free from their desks and pens and boring old geography.

I see the play as taking place on a minimal stage, in the usual modern way, with 
the scenes created primarily by the words and movements of the actors. 
 
Young Canada is a musical, and the music is integral to the telling of the story.

Plot Summary

years after the death of her mother. In the nineteenth century, with little in effective 
medical care available, people often died unexpectedly. Lydia is outwardly cheerful and 
even humorous in a cynical way, but is inwardly depressed, with a sense that life is 
meaningless. Only those closest to her know the truth.  Roger Comfort, friend of Lydia's
