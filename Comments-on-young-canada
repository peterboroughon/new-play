This file will contain some comments on the play "Young Canada".. 

Young Canada is named after a painting of the late nineteenth century 
which depicts children leaving school at the the end of the day. 

Some of the music in the play is taken from a book of three part songs published in 
1869 for the Ontario school system, and other pieces are my own original work. The 
opening scene has the adults singing a  sentimental song from the 1869 book that 
speaks of the happy children coming home from school. The children sing a rather 
more cynical song of my composing in which they bless the school bell that sets 
them free from their desks and pens and boring old geography.

I see the play as taking place on a minimal stage, in the usual modern way, with 
the scenes created primarily by the words and movements of the actors.
