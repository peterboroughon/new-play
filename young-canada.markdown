# Young Canada

## A play in two acts with music.

*(Setting, small town Ontario, late spring, early summer of 1887)*

# Act 1

*(As the play opens most of the adults in the cast are on stage, going
about their business, some sweeping, some carrying bags or gardening
tools or toolboxes)*

## Scene 1 Chorus Children coming from school

*(The school bell rings and the children come pouring out of the 
school)*

**Children's chorus:**

*Freedom, freedom, blessed freedom  
Bless the bell that sets us free  
From Miss Smith and Miss Milroy  
And Mr. Johnston with a t.*

*Freedom, freedom, blessed freedom    
Bless the bell that sets us free 
From our desks and from our pens and    
Boring old geography.*

**Adults:**

*(From the "Three Part Songs" page 43)*

*They are coming happy children  
School is out and they're at play.  
Coming through the lane and orchard,  
Surely not the nearest way.*  

*Rosy cheeks and eyes that sparkle  
Laugh that's ringing loud and free   
Constant din of childish prattle,  
Not a heart but's fill'd with glee.*  
 
**Children:**

*Freedom freedom, blessed freedom,  
Bless the bell that sets us free  
From Miss Smith and Miss Milroy  
And Mr. Johnston with a t.* 

*(Lydia crosses the stage carrying a book)*

**Sadie:** Good day, Miss Murchison!

**Lydia:** Good day, Sadie. Where's Mary?

**Sadie:** Stayed late to help Miss Smith.

**Lydia:** Apple polishing.

**Sadie:** Yes Miss Murchison. I mean no, Miss Murchison.

**Lydia:** I'll see you in an hour, Sadie. 

*(Lydia goes off)*

*(At the front of the stage, Miss Smith, Mary and the two Lizzies. The
girls are wiping desks and sweeping the floor.)*

**Miss Smith:** What would I do without you girls?

**Mary:** We just like to help, Miss Smith.

**Lizzie One:** Many hands make light work, my mother says.

**Lizzie Two:** We're model pupils, aren't we Miss Smith?

**Miss Smith:**  Certainly you are, Lizzie Two.

**Mary:** Not at all like those rotten boys.

**Miss Smith:** Now be charitable. Mary. We must hope that
someday the sinners will return to the fold. Thank you girls.
Now you had better hurry on home. Your families will be wondering
where you are.

**Girls:** Yes, Miss Smith.

*(Mary and the two Lizzies sing the Model School song)*

*Model students are we three  
Credits to the school are we,  
So unlike those rotten boys,  
Always making so much noise.*

*We are earnest. we are keen   
We do well on every test  
Fingernails are always clean  
That's why Miss Smith likes us best.* 

*Always helpful and respectful  
With our lessons neatly done,    
We are indispensable  
Though we never have much fun* 

*(The boys come running by and pull the bow from
one of the girls' hair)*

**Mary and the Two Lizzies:**

Hey! Rotten boys!
 
**Adults:**

*They are coming happy children  
School is out and they're at play.  
Coming through the lane and orchard,  
Surely not the nearest way.*  

*Rosy cheeks and eyes that sparkle  
Laugh that's ringing loud and free   
Constant din of childish prattle,  
Not a heart but's fill'd with glee.*  

  

## Scene 2 The Murchison household; Pressing flowers

*(In the parlour of the Murchison household. Aunt Harriet is
pressing flowers between pages of a book. Lydia is trying to
read, while her younger sister Mary chatters about her teacher.)*

**Harriet:**
And where have you been young lady?

**Mary:**
The two Lizzies and me stayed behind to help Miss Smith.

**Harriet:**
Two Lizzies and I, dear.

**Mary:** And you? Oh, I see.

*(Looks at the flowers)*

Miss Smith says that it's sad to press flowers.

**Harriet:** Does she indeed? Well, you tell Miss Smith...

*(recollects herself)*

Why does Miss Smith object to pressing flowers, may I ask?

**Mary:** She says that we ought to enjoy the flowers in their natural
state, and let them live out their lives under the sun, not keep
their poor flattened corpses in the house as decorations.

**Harriet:** *(Disconcerted)* Well, everyone is entitled
their opinion. I have my own, and I may share it with Miss
Smith, if the opportunity arises. I have always loved to
press flowers.  Poor flattened corpses indeed. My pressed
flowers bring  me a breath of summer through the long days
of winter.

**Mary:**
Miss Smith says we should enjoy each season in turn, and not long
for one season while in the midst of another.

**Harriet:**
*(Nettled)*
Mary, would you run and make the tea? I think I hear the kettle.
And mind that you don't scald yourself.

**Mary:**
Yes, Auntie, I mean... no Auntie.

*(Mary goes off)*

**Harriet:**

*Miss Smith says this, Miss Smith says that,*
*Miss Smith has mighty firm opinions*
*Day by day we we hear them all*
*From one of her most faithful minions.*

*Pity poor Aunt Harriet, forty years now out of school,*
*But still in class, and don't you doubt it*
*Can't do a blessed thing she wants.*
*If she does she'll hear about it.*

*Miss Smith says this, Miss Smith says that,
She knows just what we ought to do,
But I have my opinions too,
And when I can I'll share them with
Miss Smith.*

I'm glad that Mary is so taken with her teacher, but my
word, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her. And I have
to say that she sounds very opinionated.  Probably one of those
frustrated old spinsters.

*(Lydia chuckles)*

I heard that, young woman. I may be an old spinster myself, but
I'm not frustrated.  I've lived life to the fullest. In a
respectable sort of way.

**Lydia:**
I wasn't laughing about that, Auntie. But Margaret Smith  isn't
any older than I am. This is only her second year of teaching.

**Harriet:**
My la. I hate to think of what she will be like in a few years. 

**Lydia:**
She's quite nice, really. Maybe a little earnest.

**Harriet:**
How do you know her?

**Lydia:**
Sunday school. She teaches with me. 

**Harriet:**
A glutton for punishment. Teaching the little monsters all week
and going back for more on Sunday. She can't be quite all there. 

*(Lydia laughs and goes back to her book.)*

I know that you're trying to read, my dear but would you go and
see how Mary is doing in the kitchen?

**Lydia:** *(Shutting her book and rising.)*
I don't mind. It's a pretty dull story anyway.  

**Harriet:**
Drawn from the author's own life, I suppose. I do wish
people wouldn't be told to write about what they know.

**Lydia:**
*(Laughs)*
Speaking of teaching, I have Sadie coming in a few minutes for her lesson.

**Harriet:**
Oh Lord. I'll stick some wool in my ears.

**Lydia:**
You're not a music lover, Auntie.

**Harriet:**
Yes. I am. That is the problem.

**Lydia:**
Everyone has to learn somehow. And the rest of us have to be patient.

*(Goes off)*

*(Harry and Roger come in)*

**Harry:**
I give up. You're hopeless.

**Roger:**
Oh come now.

**Harry:**
How many times have I tried to explain cricket to you, and how
many times have I failed miserably?

**Roger:**
Half a dozen, at a guess. But consider... perhaps the fault lies
more with your explanations than with my understanding.

**Harry:**
*(In disgust)*
Bah.

**Roger:**
Besides which, who really understands cricket, anyway?  I thought
the essence of the game is in the deep mystery of what it all means. 

**Harry:**
Nonsense. Cricket is perfectly straightforward. You simply have
to understand a few...

**Roger:**
I don't have to understand the rules. I don't play,
and if I watch I clap politely when everyone else does. Everyone
assumes I know what's happening, or I...assume so.  It all works out nicely.

*(Harry shakes his head in disgust.)*

Good afternoon, Miss Murchison.

**Harriet:**
Good afternoon, Roger. 

**Harry:**
I've asked Roger for a bite of supper, if that's all right. We're
off to go bowling with some other chaps tonight.

**Harriet:**
It won't be anything fancy. We'll probably just scramble some
eggs. There's some nice fresh bread. How is my money, Roger?

**Roger:**
*(Taken by surprise, and looks laughing at Harry)*
Ah. Doing just fine, the last time I checked. Earning three percent
interest per annum.

**Harriet:**
Is that good?

**Roger:**
Excellent. You should double your capital in twenty three years.
Provided that you don't spend any of it, of course.

**Harriet:**
And quadruple it in forty six years, I suppose? I believe that's
worth waiting around for.

**Roger:**
You will outlive us all, I'm sure, Miss Murchison.

**Harriet:**
And what did you think of Ireland? Is it as green as they say?

**Roger:**
*(Puzzled)*
But I've never been to Ireland.

**Harriet:**
You can't have kissed the Blarney stone, and not have been to
Ireland.
*(Roger smiles and Harriet rises)*
I'll go see about supper. And you two had better wash your hands. 

**Harry:**
Especially you, Roger. After handling all that grubby money. Who
knows where it's been.

**Roger:**
I don't believe money is contagious. If only it was.

**Harriet:**
And if you want tea you'll have to have it in the kitchen. Lydia
is teaching.

*(Lydia walks in. Roger and Lydia see each other and pause for a
moment)*

**Lydia:**
Good day, Roger. How are you?

**Roger:**
I can't complain.

**Lydia:** Of course you can't complain, poor chap.
You've sold your soul to the bank.

**Roger:**
No, Lydia. Only my carcase. My soul remains my own. Such as it is.

**Harry:**
*(Feigns yawning)*
And so endeth the sermon. Come along Reverend Comfort. And speaking of
cricket, let's try again.  

*(The door bell rings. Lydia goes and lets Sadie in, and Harry and Roger
go off.)*

## Scene 3 The piano lesson

**Sadie:**
Good day, Miss Murchison.

**Lydia:**
Good day, Sadie. What on earth happened to your music book?


**Sadie:**
I'm very sorry Miss Murchison. The dog ate part of
it.

**Lydia:**
A dog that loves music. I'm glad to hear it. Did he leave any
notes for you to play?

**Sadie:**
Oh yes, quite a lot of them. He only nibbled the edges.

**Lydia:**
I see. A superficial appreciation of music. It's very common.
Of course five-finger exercises aren't very musical. But we must 
do them.

**Sadie:**
If they aren't very musical, Miss Murchison, then why do we have 
to do them?

**Lydia:**
Because someone else told us we had to.

**Sadie:**
But who told them?

**Lydia:**
Someone else. We mustn't ask awkward questions, Sadie. 

**Sadie:**
No, Miss Murchison.

**Lydia:**
Civilization rests on the faith that someone someplace must
know what they're doing. 

**Sadie:**
Yes, Miss Murchison.

**Lydia:** Appearances to the contrary.

**Sadie:**
Yes, Miss Murchison.

**Lydia:**
Let's have exercise number 11. We were working on number 11?

**Sadie:**
Yes Miss.

*(Sadie plays the exercise)*

**Lydia:**
*(Singing)*
*I have only got five fingers  
Just five fingers on each hand  
But they are such stalwart comrades  
What a merry little band.*  

*(speaking)*

Now try number twelve. It is almost the same but has a
little change.

**Sadie:**

*I have only got five fingers  
on each hand to play this tune.   
If I do not grow some new ones  
I will surely run* 

*(Spoken)*

out soon. I ran out of fingers!
I need some more.

**Lydia:** Now Sadie, if you needed a different finger for
every key you would need eighty-eight fingers. How many on
each hand?

**Sadie:** Um. Forty-three?

**Lydia:** Forty-four. I don't think you would want
forty-four fingers on each hand.

**Sadie:** I could scare my brother! *(wiggles her fingers)*.

**Lydia:** Yes, but it would make it very hard to hold a
tea cup. No, to play more than five notes under each hand,
you have to move your hands, to reach more notes.

*You may only have five fingers,  
Such a tiny little band  
But these few can play as many  
If you learn to move your hand.*


**Sadie:** *(Looking at book)*  What does "Gradus Ad Parnassum" mean?

**Lydia:** It means the "steps to Parnassus". That's a high 
mountainous place in Greece. It really means the steps to learning to 
do something very lofty and grand. 

**Sadie:** Like being the very very best at playing the piano.

**Lydia:** Yes, that's right.  

**Sadie:** I don't think I care much about being the very very best
at playing the piano.

**Lydia:** But why not?

**Sadie** I think that what matters is to be with people you love,
and be happy. You don't have to be the very very best at anything. 
Somebody else can be best. I don't mind. That's what I think, anyways. 

**Lydia:** Oh.

**Sadie:** I haven't hurt your feelings, have I?

**Lydia:** No, Sadie, you haven't hurt my feelings.

**Sadie:** I still like coming here, and learning to play the piano.

**Lydia:** Thank you, Sadie. Let's try it again.

### Song Gradus Ad Parnassum

*Who is pupil, who is teacher  
Who is great and who is small,  
Who shall lead and who shall follow  
Doesn't matter much at all*  

*When hand in hand we walk together   
Up the Gradus Ad Parnassum  
And when we reach the lofty heights  
We find our steps have led us home.*

*Ever learning from each other,    
Teachers, pupils, students all  
Attend this school where none is master  
None shall stumble none shall fall*

*When hand in hand we walk together   
Up the Gradus Ad Parnassum  
And when we reach the lofty heights  
We find our steps have led us home.*

*(A little piano music ends the scene and Lydia comes and sits 
at the dinner table.)*

## Scene 4 Dinner conversation Lydia and Roger 

**Harry:**

All I'm saying is that politics is a rough and dirty business,
and I am sorry indeed to see any of the gentle sex embroiled
in it. Surely you agree, Roger?

**Roger:**
Well, I um... 

**John:**
Will you pass the pickles please Harry?

**Harry:**
What? Oh, yes Father. The pickles...

*(Passes the pickles)*

**Harriet:**
I can tell you Master Harry that women are quite accustomed
to rough and dirty business, in the kitchen for one thing.

**Harry:**
But that's different of course.

**Harriet:**
And your poor mother, God rest her soul, wasn't above
tending to your soiled napkins. Speaking of rough and dirty
business.

*(Embarrassed laughter around the table, except for Harry whose dignity is outraged)*

**Harry:**
Oh Auntie, for goodness sakes.

**John:**
Harriet.  I think we should all be sorry to be reminded of
our sordid pasts.

**Harriet:**
True enough. 

*(To Harry)*

I'm sorry, dear.

**Mary:**
Miss Smith...

**Harriet:**
Mary, I think we've heard enough about Miss Smith for one
day.

**Mary:**
I was only going to say that Miss Smith is a corresponding
member of the Toronto Women's Suffering Society.

**John:**
Suffering? I think you mean suffrage, Mary.

**Mary:**
No, Father. I'm pretty sure it's suffering.

**Harry:**
It's the men that do the suffering, eh Roger, when they meet
those women. 

**Roger:**
Oh, I don't know, Harry.  I'm not afraid of women that can
think for themselves.

*(looking at Lydia)*

I mean women who like to read and so on.

**Lydia:**
Don't look at me, Roger. I read nothing but trash.

**John:**
Is that so? 

**Lydia:**
Oh no Papa. I was joking. All of my reading is of the most
serious and elevated nature. Mostly books of sermons and
treatises on natural philosophy. That sort of thing.

**John:** If I thought that was true, I would really be worried.

**Harry:**
*(Ignoring his father and Lydia, and turning to Roger)*
But you can't seriously mean that you approve of extending
suffrage to women.

**Roger:**
I wouldn't go as far as that...

**Harriet:**
And why not? Not that I care very much myself, but why
shouldn't women have the vote? 

**Roger:**
Well, I, um, hadn't given the question much thought, to tell the truth.
What do you think, Lydia?

**Lydia:**
It hardly matters what I think. I would be too lazy to use
the vote if I had it. 

**Roger:**
You wouldn't want to vote?

**Lydia:**
Heavens no. Let men go on making the brilliant choices they
have made so far, and we are sure to reach utopia.

**Roger:**
But, uh...utopia means "nowhere". I believe.

*(Lydia smiles and raises her eyebrows archly at Roger.)*

**Harry:**
I still hold that women have no place in politics. And it sounds very
improper for this Miss Smith, as a  teacher, to be advocating for a 
radical organization. I am surprised that the school board puts up with it.

**John:**
There isn't much point in quarrelling over an abstraction.
Women are unlikely to obtain the vote in our
lifetime, whatever anybody says. Harriet, I think you said
you have made an excellent pudding?


## Scene 5  Chorus Evening and the MacCorquodales

*(The stage is filled with the chorus, going about their business,
gardening, or chatting in the summer evening. The children are running
here and there)*

**Chorus:**

*(Singing From Three-part Songs page 85)*

**Sopranos:** 

How calm is the evening's quiet light.

**Altos:**

How calm is the evening's quiet light.

**Men:** 

How calm is evening's quiet light.

**All voices:**

How calm is the evening's quiet light,
Great Nature's face how fair,
When o'er the woodland bends the night,
And hushed the earth and air, and hushed the earth and air.

*(To one side of the stage at MacCorquodale's Cheap Cash Store)*

**Mrs. Hale:** Bless you, Miss MacCorquodale. (Hurries out
and nearly runs into Mr. MacCorquodale. She looks at him
in fright and breaks into a run)

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** *(To Becky)*. I see Mrs. Hale has come
into money at last. What did you sell her?

**Becky:** Not much. A little lamp oil. A can or two of beans.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** A can or two. Which is it girl, one can
or two?

**Becky:** Three.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:**  Well fair enough if she has the money for
it, she can have whatever she wants.

**Becky:** Papa...

**Mr. MacCorouodale:**  What's that?

**Becky:** Papa, I gave her credit.

**Mr. MacCorouodale:** You what?

**Becky:** She had nothing in the house. Her husband is away.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:**  Can I trust no one? The minute my
back is turned everythinq goes to damnation. Listen
Becky. What is this store called?

**Becky:** MacCorquodale's.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Aye. And what else? Tell me.

**Becky:** MacCorquodale's Cheap Cash Store.

**Mr. MacCorouodale:** That's right. Nothing goes out that
door except for cash. Cash on the counter, cash in the
till.

*(Song)*

*I canna count the times I've said it  
We sell for cash and we don't take credit  
It's cheap for cash and we don't take credit  
At MacCorquodale's cheap cash store.* 

*You know damn well what I always say   
They can have it cheap but they'll have to pay  
If you let it stand, if you bide your time  
Then you'll bide your time till the judgement day.*


*I canna count the times I've said it  
We sell for cash and we don't take credit  
It's cheap for cash and we don't take credit  
At MacCorquodale's cheap cash store.* 

**Betsy:**

*There are casks of nails and bright tin pails,  
And there's cans below and there's cans above  
But you'll never find a word of love  
In MacCorquodale's cheap cash store.*  

**Mr. MacCoquodale:**

*I canna count the times I've said it  
We sell for cash and we don't take credit  
It's cheap for cash and we don't take credit  
At MacCorquodale's cheap cash store.* 

**Becky:** A little oil and three cans of beans.
*(Writing)*

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** I've told you time and time again. I'm 
doing this for you, so I'll have something to leave you.

**Becky:** Here, Papa.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** What's this?

**Becky:** My note  for a little lamp oil and three cans of
beans.  You can take it out of whatever you leave me.

*(Becky runs out of the store.)*


**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Becky, come back! 

I just hope that Mrs. Hale  doesn't tell everyone that she got
credit at this store.

**Chorus:**

**First Woman:** Well, he's at it again.

**First Man:** It don't take much to set him off.

**Second Woman:** I just feel sorry for that daughter of his. Can't be 
much of a life for her, with a father like that.

**Second Man:** She'll marry soon enough and get away.

**First Woman:** Harry Murchison was keeping company with her, but that
father of her's put him off. Who's going to want MacCorquodale's
daughter and him for a father-in-law? 

**Second Woman:** Poor girl.

**First Man:** A gentle word. It don't cost much.

**Second Man:** No, but you couldn't buy one at MacCorquodale's store. Not even for cash.

*(Song: A Gentle word: "Three Part Songs Page 18)*

*A gentle word, it falls like balm  
Upon the weary heart,  
And calms the agony within  
With more than magic art*

*A gentle word, it hath the power  
To win the erring back  
Though they have wandered far away  
From virtue's narrow track.*

*A gentle word!, oh give to all  
Sweet gentle words of love;  
For they shall all return to thee  
From God's own lips above.*


## Scene  6  Morning at the school Miss Milroy and Mr.Johnston

*(Morning. The school bell sounds and the children come trooping
reluctantly to school)*

**Mrs. Maybee:** And don't dawdle on the way home. I have chores for you to do!

*(At the school)*

**Miss Milroy:** Far be it from me to utter a word of criticism against a 
fellow teacher.

**Mr. Johnston:** Certainly not, Miss Milroy. I believe the children will
be here soon.

**Miss Milroy:** But those boys in Miss Smith's class are running wild, 
absolutely wild.

**Mr. Johnston:** Surely not? 

**Miss Milroy:** But they are. Positively disrespectful, to the school 
to the teachers, to everything and everybody.

**Mr. Johnston:** I will have a word with Miss Smith, but I know
she is doing her best with them. 

*(Nervously)*

In fact I believe that they are a little afraid of her. I am
rather myself...well never mind.  Please don't upset yourself.
And now, I believe the children are here.

**Miss Milroy:** Yes Mr. Johnston. If only they wanted to learn.

**Mr. Johnston:** Yes, I quite understand.

**Miss Milroy:** *(Walking away)* You don't understand. Nobody understands.

**Mr. Johnston:** I do understand. It
will soon be the vacation. In the meanwhile, once more into
the breach..!

**Miss Milroy:** Ours is but to do or die.

**Mr. Johnston:** That's the spirit, Miss Milroy.


## Scene  7 Dirty Jim, Miss Milroy and Miss Smith

*(Schoolyard. Dirty Jim. At the start of the scene the children
are playing games, as "Dirty Jim" and the Rotten Boys come
swaggering on.)*

**Mary:** Oh, oh. Here they come! 

**Lizzie One:** Dirty Jim!

**Lizzie Two:** And those rotten boys!

**Jim:** Make way everyone. The boys are here.

**Children:** 

*(Singing)*

*There was one dirty Jim, tis reported of him  
And twill tell to his lasting disgrace  
His expression was mean and he often was seen  
With an ugly smirk on his face.*
 
**Jim:** That's me. And who wants to make something of it?

*(Singing)*

*I don't wash my hands and I don't comb my hair,   
And I don't give a hang for no one.  
I curse and I hammer that old English grammar  
And my lessons are always undone!*

**Boys:**

*And his lessons are always undone!  
Hurray!*


**Jim:**
*No one knows what I'm up to and that's just as well;   
What I'm up to is gen'rally shady.  
If you want a chore done then I'm not the one  
And I won't hold a door for a lady!*


**Boys:**

And he won't hold a door for a lady!  
Hurray!"


**Children:** 

*(Singing)*

*There was one dirty Jim, tis reported of him  
And twill tell to his lasting disgrace  
His expression was mean and he often was seen  
With an ugly smirk on his face.*
 
*(Sammy appears carrying a book)*

**Jim:**

There's Sammy Maccrocodile! Get him boys!

*(Miss Milroy comes along)*

**Miss Milroy:** Now stop that you boys!

*(The Rotten Boys pay no attention to her)*

Stop it I say! I will tell Mr. Johnston... stop it!

*(The Rotten Boys chase Sammy, until they run into Miss
Smith)*

**Miss Smith:**

*(Sternly)*

What's this, Jimmy Hughes? Tormenting poor Sammy again?

**Jim:** No, no, Miss. We were just playing a game.

**Miss Smith:** It didn't look like a game to me, Jimmy
Hughes. Beware! Reform yourself, or you will be reformed!

**Jim:** What does that mean? Reform?

**Miss Smith:**
I'm not surprised you don't know.

*(Singing)*

*The prophets of old with a glint in their eye  
And their beards nearly down to their shins  
Were prone to upbraiding back-sliding mankind  
With a elbow length list of its sins.*

*As they stood on the mountaintop awful to see   
In the wind and the rain and the storm,    
They would hurl that one word that would roll down like thunder    
That thundering word was reform!*  

*Reform! Reform! That thundering word was reform!*  

*The modern day prophets  wear jackets and ties  
Or dresses of fashionable cut,  
But don't let that fool you, or lead you astray  
Are they soft? No they're anything but!*

*They don't need a mountaintop, nor a loud storm    
They can spot Jimmy Hughes on the level.   
If you don't watch your step, if you don't mend your ways   
The reformers will give you the...*  

*(spoken)*

Well, a very hard time.

*(singing)*

*Reform, Jimmy Hughes! Reform! The operative word is reform!*  

Time for class, children. Come along, Sammy.

*(Sammy and the other children follow Miss Smith, but the
Rotten boys hold back)*

*(Miss Milroy goes in)*

**Jim:** Miss Smith  can't tell me what to do. I'll get her back and
that Sammy MacCrocodile too.

**One of the Boys:** what cha going to do, Jim?

**Jim:** Don't know yet. But I'll tell you this boys. I'll think
of something.


## Scene  8  Miss Milroy and Mr. Johnston

*(Miss Milroy and Mr. Johnston)*

**Miss Milroy:** They ought to have listened to me.

**Mr. Johnston:** Certainly they ought. I will have a stern word with
those boys. They will listen to me. 

**Miss Milroy:** Some days I have doubts. 

**Mr. Johnston:** *(Taken aback)* I beg your pardon.

**Miss Milroy:** Doubts about  the value of trying to teach.

**Mr. Johnston:** Oh I see.  It can be discouraging, Heaven knows. 

**Miss Milroy:** Oh what is the purpose in trying to reach
Those who will not be reached.

**Miss Milroy:** *(Singing)* 

*In coming  to teach it was not my design
To squander my days casting pearls before swine.*

**Mr. Johnston:** Perhaps we should not refer to the children as...er.

**Miss Milroy:** 

*Not to pare down the point nor to make it too fine,
I think I've been wasting my time, my time,
I think I've been wasting my time.*

**Mr. Johnston:** But surely not, my dear, my dear..um Miss...Milroy.

**Miss Milroy:**

*In the flower of my youth setting out as a teacher  
With my arms full of books and my mind on the future  
There was no friend to warn me of coming disaster and
That I'd be wasting my time, my time,
That I be wasting my time.* 

*When I've nothing to show at the end of a day,
When I feel my weeks sliding and slipping away,
And after them tumble the months and the years I say
Surely I'm wasting my time, my time!
Surely I'm wasting my time.!*

**Mr. Johnston:**

*To teach what you love and to love what you teach
To share with your pupils the good and the true,
Is the highest attainment a teacher can reach
To pass on a knowledge you know will live after you*

**Miss Milroy:**

*None of them listen and none of them care,
indeed they quite fail to notice I'm there
In these circumstances it's hardly unfair
To say I've been wasting my time. Mr. Johnston,
To say that I've wasted my time.*


**Mr. Johnston:**

I am distressed... I am dismayed... I had no idea you were feeling so 
discouraged, my dear, my dear... er Miss Milroy. Perhaps you... that
is to say we...should consider...that is to say...consider what a
change in your condition of life might do for you.


**Miss Milroy:**

A change? In my condition?

**Mr. Johnston:**

I beg your pardon. I spoke out of turn. 



## Scene 9 Sunday Morning and going to church

**Chorus:**

*(Sunday morning. Singing The Swiss Morning Hymn from Three Part Songs page 134)*

*Morn awakes in silence, still in the vaulted sky  
Stars with fading lustre, gems its canopy.  
Hail! Then hail fair morning's gleam!  
Praise to him who kindleth every sunny beam,  
Swell your grateful voices, bend in adoration,  
Praise the Lord of Light.  
Bend in adoration,  
Praise the Lord of Light.  
Lord of every land and nation:  
Throned in boundless might,  
Throned in boundless might,  
In boundless might.*

**Mrs. Hughes:** Thank Heaven for Sunday, a day of rest.  Once I have
the hens fed and  the ham sliced and the sandwiches made and the
picnic basket packed and we're out of  church and the Sunday school
picnic is over with, and we've had a something for supper and
everything is cleaned up and put away then I'll have a good rest!
Where's that Jim of mine?  Jim!  Drat that boy. Never around when
there's work to be done!

*(John, Harriet, Harry, Roger,  Lydia, and Mary come walking to
church in their Sunday best.)*

**Harry:** Roger, why don't you sit with us today? No point
in sitting there at the back by yourself.

**Roger:** If no one objects. To my singing, that is.

**Harriet:** Sit beside Lydia. She's a music teacher. She'll
keep you on the straight and narrow.

**Roger:** Even a music teacher can't work miracles.

**Lydia:** I'm reminded of that every lesson I teach. It's
all right, Roger. If you don't expect miracles of me, I
won't expect them of you.

*(Other neighbours join the Murchison party. The
MacCorquodales, Mr. MacCorquodale, Becky, and Sammy come
along)*

**John:** Good morning, Mr. MacCorquodale. A fine Sunday
morning. 

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** It'll rain later on, likely. I can feel it. 

**Becky:** How are you, Harry?

**Harry:** Well enough. And you?

**Becky:** Well enough. I haven't seen much of you, lately. 

**Harry:** Oh, you know. One thing and another...

**Lydia:** Will I see you in Sunday school after church, Sammy?

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** You will.

**Lydia:** And at the church picnic?

**Becky:** Yes we'll be there. You'll be there, Harry?

**Harry:** Oh, I imagine so. 

*(Miss Smith comes along, carrying a hymn book)*

**John:** Good morning. Miss Smith. 

**Miss Smith:** Good morning Mr. Murchison.

**John:** Mr. Johnston has been telling me good things about
you.

**Miss Smith:** Has he? I am surprised. He always looks so
nervous when I speak to him. I can't think why. Good morning
Sammy. You have a different teacher today. *(Smiles at
Lydia)*

*(The cast gathers as a congregation and sings a hymn)*

*Though thousands strong my foes should be  
A vast and glowering army,  
Yet am I assured of victory  
If thou alone art with me.*  

*Against the power of Satan's host  
I would fight without avail,  
But with God my armour and my shield  
I surely will prevail.*

*Through all the many trials of life,  
Disappointments and vexations,  
I will find a present help in thee  
Oh Lord of my salvation.*

*In the hours of loneliness and grief  
Be a comfort failing never,  
And take me home at last with thee  
To live with thee forever.*

*(Most of the cast go off, conversing with one another as
they go, but a small group of children including Sammy seat
themselves with Lydia)*

**Lydia:** And the dove returned with a bit of green in her
beak. And Noah and his family were glad.

**Child:** Why were they glad?

**Lydia:** It meant that the waters that had covered the
earth were going down, and that green things were growing
again. The great flood was almost over. All the animals that
Noah had saved could go back to living on the earth.

**Sammy:** And all the bad people were drowned.

**Lydia:** Yes, Sammy. All right everyone. Class dismissed. I hope to
see most of you at the picnic.

*(All the children except Sammy rise and go off)*

**Lydia:** You ought to be getting to the picnic too, Sammy.

**Sammy:** I like it here. Miss Murchison, do you think
there could be another flood?

**Lydia:** A great flood like in the Bible. I wouldn't
worry.

**Sammy:** I'm not worried. I want another flood.

**Lydia:** Sammy! But why?

**Sammy:** To drown all the bad people.

**Lydia:** I see. What bad people do you have in mind?

**Sammy:** Dirty Jim and the Rotten boys.

**Lydia:** It would be hard to drown just them and not
everyone else.	Like you and me, and your father, and Becky. 

**Sammy:** We could build a boat. Like Noah.

**Lydia:** Do you know how to build a boat?

**Sammy:** I can get a hammer. No, I don't know how. Maybe
I'll just run away.

**Lydia:** Where would you run to?

**Sammy:** I have secret hiding place. It's not far away.

**Lydia:** A secret hiding place. That sounds like fun.

**Sammy:** It's special. I've never taken anybody there.

**Lydia:** I sometimes hid in a big hollow tree. One summer.
But the next summer the bees had made a hive. That scared me away.
Is your hiding place a hollow tree?

**Sammy:** No, it's a cave, a real cave. Would you like to see it?

**Lydia:** Well, I *(Sees the look on Sammy's face)* . Yes, Sam. I'd like to see it.

**Sammy:** Can you climb?

**Lydia:** Why... I suppose I can. I used to love to climb. 

**Sammy:** Can I take you there?

*(Miss Smith comes in)*

**Miss Smith:** All ready for the church picnic?

**Lydia:** We'll be along shortly. Sammy wants to show me
a cave.

**Sammy:** *(protesting)* It's a secret!

**Miss Smith:** We'll keep it a secret then. We'll see you
soon.

## Scene 10 church picnic

*(The church picnic)*


**Chorus:**

*(Coming on with baskets)*

*(Song Shall We Go To The Woods? Page 37 of Three-part Songs)*
*Shall we go to the woods where the evergreen grows    
Whose leaves drink the dew and decay never knows,  
We will sportively chat and merrily sing  
And drink of the water that flows from the spring.*

*Will you, will you, will you, will you go to the wood?  
*Will you, will you, will you, will you go to the wood?  

**Men:**

*We will sit by the rill as it joyously gleams*  
*Like jewels that shine in the bright sunny beams;*  

**Women:**

*No wonder it dances with joy on its way,*  
*Twill surely find welcome where 'er it may stray.*

**All:**

*Will you, will you, will you, will you go to the wood?*  
*Will you, will you, will you, will you go to the wood?*  



*(Lydia and Sammy have climbed to Sammy's secet hiding
place.)*

**Lydia:** Aunt Harriet's not going to be too pleased with
me. Climbing a hill in my Sunday dress. I hope your hiding place is
worth it.

**Sammy:** I'm sorry. It's my fault.

**Lydia:** No it isn't, Sam. I decided to come up here. And a
brown dress doesn't show the dirt. Much. *(Dusts herself off
ruefully)*.  So this is your secret hiding place. It's pretty
good at that. I would never know where you were. You can't see
this little cave from below with those bushes in the way.

**Sammy:** I have my things here. A jug for water, and a cup. A
book. Robinson Crusoe. My penknife.  You can see the steamboats
at the wharf, sometimes.  I pretend its a desert island. 

**Lydia:** Look.  There are the people going to the picnic. We
shouldn't stay too long. Your family will be wondering where you are.

**Sammy:** Becky might wonder. I don't think my father cares very much
what happens to me.

**Lydia:** I'm sure he does, Sam.  Anyway, I'm getting hungry.  Aren't you?

**Sammy:** Just a little while longer. Miss Murchison, do you have
a secret hiding place?

**Lydia:** I guess everybody has. Not the same as yours. 

**Sammy:** What is your hiding place like?

**Lydia:** It's not a real place, just a place I see in my
imagination.

*(singing)*

*Yes I have a hiding place   
Where I have sometimes gone  
When this world has got me down  
And I could not go on.*  

*The sun is always shining there, there isn't rain,  
There isn't any sickness and there isn't any pain.   
All my favourite things are there, laid out in a row,   
All my favourite people too, every one I know.*

*The flowers there are beautiful, 
The trees are tall and fair  
Their leaves are rustling in the breeze,   
And bird song fills the air.* 

*Where my secret hiding place is I cannot say, I don't know.  
But when I close my eyes and I dream then I go.  
Nothing ever changes there, no one goes away,  
Everything and everyone you love is there to stay.*

**Sammy:** Miss Murchison?

**Lydia:** Yes?

**Sammy:** Your hiding place...it's like heaven, isn't it?

**Lydia:** Perhaps it is.

**Sammy:** My Mama is in heaven.

**Lydia:** Mine too.

**Sammy:** Why do people have to die?

**Lydia:** I don't know, Sam. Some things even a Sunday school
teacher doesn't know.

*(Becky is heard calling)*

**Becky:** Sammy! Sam! Where are you?

*(Lydia goes to call, but Sammy holds her back)*

**Sammy:** Don't call her. I don't want Becky  to know where my
hiding place is.

**Lydia:** But Sammy... all right.

**Sammy:** Promise you won't tell anybody else about my
hiding place?

**Lydia:** I promise.  But your family will be worried. We'd better
go down.

*(As Lydia and Sammy climb down, the cast are seated on the
stage. Miss Smith walks on.)*

**John:** Miss Smith. Have you seen Lydia?

**Miss Smith:** Yes, she stayed back... to...ah... answer a question
for Sammy MacCorquodale. They'll be along shortly.

**Harry:** *(To Becky seated with her father nearby)* There you 
are, Becky. That's where Sammy is. 

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** I told Sammy to be here promptly at one
o'clock. I didn't mean a quarter after the hour.  Why will that boy
not do what he is told? 

**Mrs. Maybee:** Children today are not what we were. We did what
we were told.

**Mrs. Hughes:** I can't fault my boy, Jimmy. He's
everything a son should be, aren't you Jim?

*(Jimmy grins)*

As long as I keep a good hold of his ear!

*(Jimmy squeals in protest as his mother twists his ear. Jimmy
runs away, rubbing his ear.  Lydia comes on with Sammy. When
Jimmy sees Sammy he assumes a swagger and walks by Sammy with a
leer. Harry and Miss Smith are engaged in earnest conversation)*

**Harry:** I quite see your point, Miss Smith.

**Miss Smith:** Please call me Margaret.

**Harry:** Margaret, but as I was saying before...er

**Mary:** Lydia! The wheelbarrow race is almost starting.

**Lydia:** Good. I hope they enjoy themselves. 

**Mary:** Don't you want to go in it with me?

**Lydia:** Not particularly. What about going in with one of the Lizzies?

**Mary:** They're already going in together.

**Harry:** Lydia. Be a sport.

**Lydia:** But I'm starving.

**Miss Smith:** *(Jumping up)* I'll go in with you, Mary.

**Mary:** Oh would you, Miss Smith?

**Miss Smith:** I take it you will be the wheelbarrow?

*(Mary and Miss Smith go off. Harry looks disconcerted.)*

**Roger:** I hear music. They'll be dancing over at the platform.

**Harriet:** On a Sunday? What is the world coming to?

**Roger:** I heard someone say the minister has advanced views. He likes to dance.

**Harriet:** Dancing down the road to Hell! 

**John:** I don't think that is quite your view, Harriet? It's a harmless amusement.

**Harry:** I've never known you to be much of a dancer, Roger.

**Roger:** Not me, but  I was thinking you might ask Miss MacCorquodale.

**Harry:** Oh, ah *(Harry and Becky look at each other)*

**Harriet:** Go on,  Harry. Just don't step on her feet.  

**Harry:** I never step on my partner's feet.  Would you like to dance, Becky?

**Becky:** I guess so. *(Smiles at Harry)* Yes, I'd like to. 

*(Harry and Becky go off)*

**Chorus:** 

*(Waltz)*

*On a fine summer day, if someone will play  
For us nothing is nicer I really must say,
If the girl I like best is the one in my arms
To go waltzing and waltzing and waltzing away.*

*We'll go waltzing and waltzing and waltzing away, 
Back and forth, back and forth, sweeping around 
Swirling and whirling delightfully twirling, our 
Feet light as air barely touching the ground.*

*As we revolve so the world spins around us 
Waltzing and walrzing and waltzing away,
Green and blue shadows and  sunlight surround us.
We'll dance for as long as the fiddle will play.* 

*We'll go waltzing and waltzing and waltzing away, 
Back and forth, back and forth, sweeping around 
Swirling and whirling delightfully twirling, our 
Feet light as air barely touching the ground.*


**Sammy:** Look!

**Lydia:** What is it, Sam?

**Sammy:** Somebody's hat is flying away.

**Lydia:** Oh dear.  Look at the poor thing run. I suppose we
shouldn't laugh.

**Harriet:** Why didn't the foolish woman use a hatpin? That's what 
they're for. 

**Roger:** Perhaps she took off her hat to fix her hair, and lost it
in the wind.

**Lydia:** Oh no. It's going into the water.

**Sammy:** You could make a kite from a straw hat. If you tied strings
to it.

**Lydia:** Yes, Sam. I suppose you could. Oh look. The man in the canoe
has picked up the hat for her. 

*(Everyone leaves the stage)*

## Scene 11 The idea of the kite

*(All the children in Miss Smith's class come 
trooping in with Miss Smith leading)*

**Miss Smith:** Now, children, when you feel the wind blow, what is
hitting your face? Sammy?

**Sammy:** I don't know. Dust?

*(Mary and the two Lizzies laugh)*

**Miss Smith:** Not a bad answer, Sam,  but not the one I was looking for. 

*(Mary has her hand up)*

Yes, Mary.

**Mary:** Air, Miss Smith?

**Miss Smith:** That's right. When you feel the wind, you feel moving
air. You can't see it you can't taste it, but your can feel it and
even hear it roaring in the heavens. The winds can turn the stones of
a mill, or carry a ship around the world. Think of a kite. In the
still air of a room, if you drop a kite it will fall to the floor. But
if you take it outside, and can get the wind to catch it, it will rise
into the air. Why is that?

*(Mary and the two Lizzies have their hands up)*

Yes, lizzie two?

**Lizzie Two:** Miss, it's because the, the... push... of the wind...pushes it, and pushes it up.  

**Miss Smith:** That's right, Lizzie Two. We call the push of the wind a force.

*Oh if I were a kite and could ride on the wind  
I would rise and fall again rise again fall again  
Twisting and turning and bobbing around 
I would fall and rise again, fall again, rise again.*

*Forgetting the strings that bound me to earth  
I would soar like the swallows in joy through the firmament, 
Halfway to heaven, halfway to paradise,  
Far and away from this sad world's lament.*

*Oh if I were a kite and could ride on the wind  
I would rise and fall again rise again fall again  
Twisting and turning and bobbing around 
I would fall and rise again, fall again, rise again.*
  
Now, what ordinary things could we make a kite of? Jimmy?

**Jimmy:** My old man's underwear.

**Miss Smith:** Yes, Jimmy, but a kite has to be made of a  stiff material.

**Jimmy:** That's my old man's underwear. He puts on in the fall and don't take it off until spring.

*(More laughter)*

**Miss Smith:** What else could we use?

**Sammy:** How about a straw hat?

**Miss Smith:** An excellent idea, Sam. A straw hat would be perfect. 
Could you find us a straw hat to make a kite of?

**Sammy:** Maybe.

**Jimmy:** I know where you can find one.



## Scene 12

**Jimmy:** Well, MacCorquodale, do you want us to leave you alone?

**Sammy:** Course I do. 

**Jimmy:** We'll leave you alone, won't we boys?

**Rotten Boys:** Sure we will.

**Jimmy:** But you have to do something for us in return.

**Sammy:**  *(suspicious)* What?

**Jimmy:** Nothing much. Just borrow Miss Milroy's hat.

**Sammy:** What for?

**Jimmy:** Miss Smith wants a hat to make into a kite. We'll give
her one.

**Sammy:** Miss Milroy would never give me her hat to turn into a
kite.

**Jimmy:** Of course she wouldn't. You don't ask her, you idiot. You 
just... borrow it.

**Sammy:** But that's stealing.

**Jimmy:** That's an ugly word, isn't it boys.

**Rotten Boys:** It sure is, Jimmy!

**Jimmy:** We like to say we borrow things.

**Sammy:**  You'll get yourselves in trouble.

**Jimmy:** Oh, we're scared, aren't we boys?

**Rotten Boys:** *(Mocking)* Ooooooo!

**Jimmy:** That's just the way things are. You take what you
can get for yourself. And the biggest of all takes it all.

### Song The Biggest Of All

*(Sung and mimed by Jimmy and the Rotten Boys)*

*Oh the biggest of all thumps the next one down  
And the next one sits on the next one down 
And the next one pounds on the next one down  
And so it goes on all over the town.*  

*While the biggest of all takes it all   
While the biggest of all takes it all  
Everyone pounds on the next one down 
And the biggest of all takes it all.*

*This is the way that it's always been 
The way that it always will be.  
The next one pounds on the next one down  
Throughout all eternity,*  

*While the biggest of all takes it all   
While the biggest of all takes it all  
Everyone pounds on the next one down 
And the biggest of all takes it all.*

**Sammy:** What will you do if you meet someone bigger than you are?

**Jimmy:** There's no one bigger than me! What do you say, MacCorquodale?
Get that hat and we'll leave you in peace. We'll even make you a member of
the gang, won't we boys.

*(Boys murmur agreement)*

**Sammy:** No thanks. I don't want to be a member of your gang.

**Jimmy:** Suit yourself, but you'll get that hat? And give it to Miss Smith
to make a kite?

**Sammy:** What'll I say if she asks me where I got it?

**Jimmy:** Tell her it was your mother's.

**Sammy:** No!

**Jimmy:** Do or we'll make your life worse than ever.

**Sammy:** All right. I'll do it.



## Scene 13

*(Lydia comes out and looks up at the sky.  A moment later Roger comes out.
Lydia turns to him and smiles.)*

**Lydia:** How did backgammon go?

**Roger:** My pocket is ten cents lighter. 

**Lydia:** Why did you let Aunt Harriet beat you?

**Roger:** Let her beat me? I appreciate the kind implication, but no,
she trounced me. The blow to my pride was considerable, but I will
recover in time.  And I will play Miss Murchison again.

**Lydia:** When you've saved up another ten cents.

**Roger:** When I've saved up another ten cents.

*(A couple pass and say good evening. Lydia and Roger reply in kind)*

**Lydia:** You're so wise, Roger. I thought you would be a demon at backgammon.

**Roger:** Wisdom doesn't imply skill in backgammon, or anything else.

**Lydia:** No. Perhaps not. I've been with you in a canoe.

**Roger:** I thought I did rather well. We both survived.

**Lydia:** Just barely. 

**Roger:** I've never thought of myself as wise. I don't suppose I
really am.  I haven't been wise enough not to fall unhappily in love.

**Lydia:**  *(Turning away)* No. Roger...you should find another girl.

**Roger:** I can't tell you why, but it doesn't quite work like that.
Not so easily.

**Lydia:** How does it work?

*(Singing)*

*When somebody loves somebody, does the world completely change?
Does the sun shake in the heavens does the sky turn dark and strange?
Does this love break on the heart like some great wave on a sea wall  
quite dispersing former passions washing former cares away?*  

**Roger:**

*(Singing)*

*That is not my understanding, that is not the love I know  
Love I think is the like the seed that softly wakes and gently grows,  
In the cruel winds of life, ever bending, never breaking  
Growing stronger through the years, even when the heart is aching.*

**Lydia:** 

*Polished wood and silver fittings that is what love means to me  
Edge of black and bands of mourning, murmured words of sympathy,
Roger you are so wise must understand what I believe 
That when we give ourselves to love, we also give ourselves to grieve.*  

**Roger:**

*Every greeting is a parting, every kiss a taking leave,  
but who would choose to never love?*  

**Lydia:**

*Who would choose to never love?*

**Lydia and Roger:**

*Who would choose to never love that they might never grieve?*

**Roger:**

It's late. I'd better be off. Good night.

*(Roger begins to walk away)*

**Lydia:** Roger?

**Roger:** Yes?

**Lydia:** Aren't you going to wish me sweet dreams?

**Roger:** That I do, tonight and every night. Sweet dreams, Lydia.


## Scene 14        On the School Roof Flying Miss Milroy's Hat

*(Miss Smith, children, chorus. Miss Milroy and Mr. Johnston.)*

**Miss Smith:** Now,  you know the rules everybody. No leaning over the
edge of the roof. Anyone who doesn't behave will go straight back down again, Jimmy.

**Jimmy:** Straight back down is right. *(Keeps back)* Yuck.

**Mary:** What's the matter, Jimmy Hughes? Don't like heights?

**Jimmy:** Don't care about them one way or other! *(Moves further back)*

**Miss Smith:** That's right. You can look, but keep back from the edge.

**Mary:** Look! There's my house! No. I'm not sure. 

**Lizzie One:** Where's mine?

**Lizzie Two:** There's mine! Look! I think it's my mother! *(Waves)* Yoo hoo!!

**Mary:** She can't hear you. It's too far away.

**Miss Smith:**

*(Sings)*

*Oh look at us look at us high on the rooftop,
Oh look at us, look at us high as the trees,
Everyone looks up in wonder to see 
Such strange celestial beings as we.*

**Miss Smith and Children:**

*(Miss Smith sings line, then children echo)*

*Oh look at us look at us high on the rooftop,
Oh look at us, look at us high as the trees,
Everyone looks up in wonder to see 
Such strange celestial beings as we.*


**Miss Milroy:** I thought it was! That's my hat! Mr. Johnston, that's my hat!

# Act 2

*(Whole cast is on stage going about evening activities)*

**Mrs. Maybee:** Time for bed, Maggie, and the rest of you.

**Mrs. Maybee's Children:**  *(All together)* No! But it's still
light! I wish we could stay up! (Etc.)

**Mrs. Maybee:**  That's enough! Wishing don't matter. Light or dark,
it's time for bed. Don't you think I don't wish for things? If I had
wings, I might fly away.

*("The Wish" page 73)*

**Whole Cast:**

*High o'er the mountains's crest   
Where the last sunbeams rest,  
At close of day;   
Had I but wings to soar  
Where the sun sets no more  
I would away.*

*Or when the stars at night  
Spangle the sky with light   
I would be there.   
Join then my hymn of love   
With that bright choir above  
Floating in air.*

*But, ah, I cannot rise   
Like a bird, through the skies,   
I cannot fly.  
Only my heart can spring   
Only my thoughts take wing  
To God on high.*

*(Lydia and Miss Smith come out onto the porch)*

**Lydia:** What is this I hear about Miss Milroy's hat?

**Miss Smith:** I'm afraid a pupil stole Miss Milroy's hat and gave to
me to make a kite of. Mr. Johnston was quite put out. Not to mention
Miss Milroy. I will have to buy her a new hat.  

**Lydia:** Which pupil?

**Miss Smith:** In strictest confidence?

**Lydia:** Of course.

**Miss Smith:** You won't tell your father?

**Lydia:** Not even him.

**Miss Smith"** Very well. It was Sammy MacCorquodale.

**Lydia:** Sam wouldn't do a thing like that. It's absurd.

**Miss Smith:** Sammy won't tell me, but I think  Jimmy Hughes and his
little gang are behind this. But Sammy is likely to be punished. 

**Lydia:** Poor Sam. What can we do about?

**Miss Smith:** I don't know. Unless Sammy tells us the truth, very
little.  I have refused to tell Mr. Johnston who stole Miss Milroy's
hat. 

**Lydia:** You refused to tell? What will happen?

**Miss Smith:** I suppose I might be dismissed. 

**Lydia:** Oh Margaret.

**Miss Smith:**
Speaking of putting things right, Lydia, I asked to have a
word with you in private,  because... I want to ask a favour.

**Lydia:** A favour?

**Miss Smith:**  More than a favour perhaps.  My position as a teacher
places some constraints on me.

**Lydia:** No doubt.

**Miss Smith:** I cannot always behave as I would wish.

**Lydia:**  *(Amused)* Margaret! Whatever can you mean?

**Miss Smith:** You know my views on votes for women.

**Lydia:** I think I do.

**Miss Smith:** The schoolboard is composed entirely of men.

**Lydia:** One of them my father.

**Miss Smith:** I don't hold that against you, I assure you.

**Lydia:** I am pleased to hear it.

**Miss Smith:**  They and Mr. Johnston have some cause to be upset
with me already.  They would not look kindly on a female teacher that
was canvassing for votes for women, on top of everything else.

**Lydia:** I suppose not.

**Miss Smith:** Lydia, will you take up the banner? Will you 
canvas on my behalf?

**Lydia:**  I... canvas? But... you know my views on votes for women.

**Miss Smith:** That if you had the right, you would not
vote. I cannot believe it. 

**Lydia:** Let me tell you something, Margaret.

**Miss Smith:** What is that?

**Lydia:** Nothing in this world matters very much. Nothing
is worth the effort.

**Miss Smith:** That is the most appalling thing I have ever
heard anybody say. And you a Sunday school teacher.

*(Lydia smiles)*

Now let me tell you something Lydia Murchison. Everything in
this world matters very much, and everything is worth the
effort.

*(Miss Smith sings alone)*

*Eyes up, chin up, head up sister Lydia,  
Youth is the season when great deeds are done.  
Hear in the distance a sisterhood is marching  
Many will join them, will you be one?*

*Dark is the night of this world's great oppression,  
Salt are the tears of those longing to be free.  
Great is the need that calls us together, 
Calls out for you and for me.*  

*(Miss Smith sings next verse while Lydia sings the one after)*

*Eyes up, chin up, head up sister Lydia,  
Youth is the season when great deeds are done.  
Your strong arm and willing heart are needed,    
Will you not join us, will you be one.*  

*Little you know what you are asking   
great is the price that I would pay   
little can you know what suffering would follow  
with my armour stripped away.*

*(Lydia alone)*

*Through so many hours I   
practised my indifference
sought out attachments and brought them to an end.
And after all I hear that   
Margaret Smith now tells me  
cruel grief and tears must be my lot again.*
 
*(Miss Smith alone)*

*Cast off this pall that hangs on your heart, and   
March from the shadows into the sun,  
Roll up your sleeves and lend us a hand for
There is  great work to be done.*  

*(Miss Smith  and Lydia)*

*Eyes up, chin up, head up sister Lydia,  
Youth is the season when great deeds are done.  
Hear in the distance a sisterhood is marching  
Many will join them,* 

*(Lydia alone)*
*I will be one.*

**Lydia:** All right, all right. What do you want me to do?

**Miss Smith:** Merely distribute some pamphlets.


*(Lights go down and come up to a rooster crow)*

## Scene 

*(Chorus Morning song p.22 of Three Part Songs)*

*(Women and girls come on from one side and Men and boys from the other)*

**Women and girls:**

*The Stars are fading from the sky  
The mists before the morning fly.*

**Men and Boys:**

*The east is glowing with a smile   
And nature, laughing all the while*

**Whole Chorus:** 
*Says Clear the way the world is waking,  
Night is gone, and day is breaking.*

**Men and Boys:**
*The cock has crow'd with all his might,*

**Women and girls:**
*The birds are singing with delight,*

**Men and Boys:**
*The hum of business meets the ear,*

**Women and girls:**
*And face to face with kindly cheer*

**Whole Chorus:** 
*Says Clear the way the world is waking,  
Night is gone, and day is breaking.*


**Men and Women:**
*The bell is ringing, haste away! 
The school is open leave off play*

**Boys and Girls:** (Spoken)
*Oh no!*

**Men and Women:** (Shaking fingers at the boys and girls)
*The sun of knowledge there we find   
Arising on the youthful mind;*

**Whole Chorus:** 
*So clear the way the world is waking,  
Night is gone, and day's beginning.  
The bell is ringing, haste away! 
The school is open leave off play*



*(Miss Milroy and Mr. Johnston)*

**Miss Milroy:** And it's not as if one could afford to buy a
new hat every day of the week. Not on a teacher's stipend.

**Mr Johnston:** I quite understand, Miss Milroy. Please
calm yourself. The children will be here soon.

**Miss Milroy:** Quite apart from the damage to my hat, it is
the indignity.  The contempt it shows for a fellow teacher.

**Mr. Johnston:** Now, Miss Smith assures me that she had no idea that
it was your hat. One her pupils gave it to her, saying that it was an
old hat of his mother's.

**Miss Milroy:** An old hat! It was practically new. Anybody could see
that. I wore it for only  a month last summer....

**Mr. Johnston:** Yes, I didn't mean to imply...

**Miss Milroy:** And which pupil?

**Mr. Johnston:** I beg your pardon?

**Miss Milroy:** Which pupil gave her the hat? That will be your thief.

**Mr. Johnston:** She, ah...refuses to tell me.

**Miss Milroy:** She refuses to tell you?

**Mr. Johnston:** Yes. More or less.  She has promised to buy you a
new hat.  And she offers her apologies.

**Miss Milroy:** She may keep her apologies and her hat.

**Mr. Johnston:** I am sorry indeed to hear you say that. It bespeaks
a bitterness that I know is not... *(stops)* 

**Miss Milroy:** As you say, the children will be here soon. I'd better be going.

**Mr. Johnston:** 
I promise you, my dear, er, my dear Miss Milroy that we will get to the
bottom of this.

**Miss Milroy:** Ask some the children in her class. They are bound to
tell you.

**Mr. Johnston:**
I am reluctant...

**Miss Milroy:** I see. 

*(Miss Milroy Off, followed sadly by Mr. Johnston)*

## Scene 4 

*(What Do You Think. The women discuss the pamphlets)*

**Mrs. Hughes:** What do you make of these pamphlets that Lydia Murchison has been handing around?

**Mrs. Minifie:** She give me one, but I didn't read it. What does it say?

**Mrs. Hughes:** After you wade through  all the fancy talk...it says that women should have the vote.

**Mrs. Minifie:** Would good would voting do me?. I'd still have six
spoiled children to cope with, seven if you count George. I'd still
have a kitchen floor to wash and meals to cook, and a pile of  clothes
to mend, that I'll never see the bottom of. . That's all right for
Lydia Murchison, with not much to do, Give her six kids and husband...

**Mrs. Maybee:** Ah, Annie, I do love to hear you talk, It cheers me up so.

**Mrs. Jacobs:** Half the human race is female. Why shouldn't we have the vote?

**Mrs. Maybee:** And what would you do with a vote if you had it? 

**Mrs. Minifie:** There's the Liberals and Conservatives to choose from, and you don't want either one.

**Mrs. Jacobs:** And why is that?

**Mrs. Minifie:** The Liberals say the Conservatives are nothing but
liars and the Conservatives say the Liberals are nothing but liars,
and I think they're both telling the truth.

**Mrs. Hughes:** But if we had the vote, at least we'd have a say..

*Maybe it's a pipe dream,   
Maybe it's a day dream,  
Maybe it's a ways away,  
When women have their say.

*But something good might come of it
and we could light a fire,  
Right some wrongs and heal some wounds  
And raise ourselves up from the mire.*

*Heaven knows that life is hard  
Hard enough for anyone.  
But if we learned to stand together    
Maybe something could be done?*  

*When women get their rights 
The sea will still be salt,  
The sun will still rise in the east
And sail through heaven's vault.*
 
And if we get to have our say,
when women get their rights,
It might not make much difference,
but then again... it might.

## Scene 

**Man 1:**  Roger. Have you seen these pamphlets?

**Roger:**  What pamphlets?

**Man 2:** Your wife must have got one.

**Roger:** I'm a bachelor. Been one all my life. So far.

**Man 2:** Oh that's right. How'd you manage that?

**Roger:** Clean living and keeping out of dark alleys. What are they
about, these pamphlets?

**Man 3:** Votes for women.

**Man 1:** Would you believe, it, votes for women. She's handing
them out to all the women.

**Roger:** Who is handing them out?

**Man 2:** John Murchison's girl, Lydia.

**Roger:** Lydia? But she's...

**Man 3:** Causing trouble. Stirring the pot.

**Man 1:** No such thing as a peaceful life. Just when things
are shaping up and going ahead nicely.

**Roger:** And are the women reading these things?

**Man 2:** Sure they're reading them, and standing around at the
gate talking, and glaring at any man that happens to
pass.

**Man 3:** Not enough to do, you see. The old fella finds
work for idle hands.

**Roger:** But not so idle, surely?

**Man 1:**

Bah. What do they have to do?

**Men:** 

*When the men go off to work and leave them all alone,
They can change the baby's nap-i-kin and the rest of the
day's their own.*

**Roger:**What about the breakfast things?

**Men:** 

*When the men go off to work and leave them all alone
And the dishes are washed and put away
They can wash the kitchen floor again,
And change the baby's nap—i—kin
And the rest of the day's their own!*


**Roger:** Of course there's dinner.

**Men:** 

*When the men go off to work and leave them all alone,    
Why as soon as the breakfast things are done   
They can pot the pot-roast and peel the potatoes   
and cut up some carrots and stew some tomatoes,   
and scrub the kitchen floor again,   
and change the baby's nap—i-kin   
And when dinner is over at just after one
they can put up their feet and twiddle their thumbs  
For the rest of the days's their own.*

**Roger:** Then they sometimes have some mending to do.

*(The other men glare at him and then draw a deep breath and sing)*


*When the men go off to work and leave them all alone,    
Why as soon as the breakfast things are done   
They can pot the pot-roast and peel the potatoes   
and cut up some carrots and stew some tomatoes,   
and scrub the kitchen floor again,   
and change the baby's nap—i-kin   
And when dinner is over at just after one  
There's not much to do in the afternoon  
But darn some socks and patch some knees 
and scrape some carrots and shell some peas  
then they put up their feet and twiddle their thumbs  
when they've  changed the baby's nap-i-cumbs 
and washed the kitchen floor again 
For the rest of the day's their own.* 

*(Men wipe their brows)*

**Roger:** Now isn't there some washing to be done?

*(The other men walk off in disgust)*

**Man 1:** What does a bachelor know about married life?

*(Music as Lydia goes around distributing pamphlets. She passes Roger
without seeing him.)* 

**Roger:** Good day, Lydia. 

**Lydia:**  Oh, Roger. Sorry. I didn't see you. 

**Roger:** No. Your mind was on something else. What do you have
there?

**Lydia:**  *(Holding up a pamphlet)* Votes for Women! Now!

**Roger:** So what they tell me is true. This is a change.  Are you serious?

**Lydia:** Sometimes I am serious. If you will excuse me, there is
much work to be done.

*(Lydia walks off, leaving Roger scratching his head and smiling, and
then Lydia returns and hands him a pamphlet, before walking off again.
She meets Mr. MacCorquodale walking across the stage and hands him a
pamphlet. He  looks at it, then glares at her as she walks away. He goes
off the opposite way carrying the pamphlet)* 

## Scene Mr. MacCorquodale arrives to demand that Miss Smith be dismissed

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Can you not control your own daughter? Are you
not master in your own house?

**John:** I am indeed, Mr. MacCorquodale, and to prove the point,
there is the door!

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Ah, peace man, I meant no harm. It's the fault
of this Miss Smith. She has us all at each other's throats.

**John:** Miss Smith? What has she to do with it?

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Ah, she's the one that gave those pamphlets to
your girl to hand out round the town. She's nothing but a
trouble-maker, and on top of that I hear she stole another teacher's
hat to make a kite! She ought to be dismissed. 

**John:** Oh come now, MacCorquodale, we've been into all of this. 
She did not steal the hat.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Well who did then?

**John:** She refuses to say.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** She refuses to say! Why there is grounds for
dismissal right there! I've had talk with the members of the school
board and we want to be rid of Miss Smith. School year's almost over. 
If we are going  to find another teacher, we will have to look smart.

**John:** Very well. We'll meet and talk it over. 

## Scene 3

*(Miss Milroy comes on, followed by Jim and the Rotten boys and
the other children)*

**Jimmy:** Hey, Miss Milroy.

**Miss Milroy:** Who is that? Oh it's you Jimmy Hughes.

**Jimmy:** The very same and only. I thought you might like to know
who stole your hat.

**Mary and the Two Lizzies:** No, Jimmy Hughes.

**Miss Milroy:** What's that? My hat?

**Jimmy:** That's right your hat. 

**Jimmy and the Rotten Boys:** 

*(Singing)*

*It was Sammy, Sammy,
Sammy MacCorquodale, Sammy MacCorquodale
Did the dreadful deed.*

*By dark of night he hatched his plot   
He would not rest until your hat he'd got  
By hook or crook or main or might  
To give Miss Smith to be a kite.*

**All the Children except Mary and the Two Lizzies:**

*It was Sammy, Sammy,
Sammy MacCorquodale, Sammy MacCorquodale
Did the dreadful deed.*

*He saw his chance the very next day  
To snatch Miss Milroy's hat away  
It hung like ripe fruit from a tree  
He reached up and he set it free.*


*(Sammy comes on and all the children except Mary and the Two
Lizzies circle him and sing)*
 
*It was Sammy, Sammy,
Sammy MacCorquodale, Sammy MacCorquodale
Did the dreadful deed.*

*It was Sammy, Sammy,
Sammy MacCorquodale, Sammy MacCorquodale
Did the dreadful deed.*


**Miss Milroy:** Come along with me, Sammy. We are going straight to 
Mr. Johnston.

**Mary and The Two Lizzies:** Oh you Rotten Boys!

*(Jimmy and the Rotten Boys fold their arms and smirk)*

**Miss Milroy:** Here, Mr. Johnston is the culprit that stole my hat!

**Mr. Johnston:** Sammy, is this true?

**Sammy:** Yes sir.

**Miss Milroy:** There, by his own admission. 

*(Miss Smith runs in)*

**Miss Smith:** Mr. Johnston. I have just heard from some of the children that Sammy has been accused of stealing 
Miss Milroy's hat. I must intervene on Sammy's behalf.

**Miss Milroy:** Did or did he not give my hat to you to make into... a kite?

**Miss Smith:** He did, but... I have already offered to replace the hat.

**Mr. Johnston:** That isn't really the point, is it, Miss Smith. We must maintain discipline and order in the school. Without that. what do we have?  

**Miss Milroy:**  Exactly, what do we have?

**Miss Smith:** But in discipline and order we must also have mercy.

**Mr. Johnston:** I will be no harsher than the offence requires. 

**Miss Milroy**
In that case, I don't see what there is to discuss.  Justice must run its course. 

**Mr. Johnston:** I am afraid that Miss Milroy is right, Miss Smith.  Please return to your classes. I will deal with Sammy.

*(Takes out the strap)*

**Miss Smith:** Oh no, Mr. Johnston!

**Mr. Johnston:** I'm sorry Miss Smith.  Come along Sammy. 

*(Mr. Johnston and Sammy)*

**Miss Smith:** Oh Miss Milroy. How could you? You who teach
compassion for the birds and butterflies, and even the worms beneath
our feet, where is your compassion  for Sammy?

**Miss Milroy:** I...

*(Miss Smith walks off. Miss Milroy stands a moment by herself and then follows Miss Smith off, as the chorus comes on)*


## Scene 

*(Chorus: Poor Little Girls of Ontario)*

**Older girls:**

*I'll sing you a song of that plaguey pest  
It goes by the name of the Great Northwest  
I cannot have a beau at all,  
They all skip out there in the fall.*

 **Chorus:**

*One by one, they all clear out,  
Thinking to better themselves, no doubt,  
Caring little how far they go  
From the poor little girls of Ontario.*

**Older Girls:**

*First I got mashed on Charley Brown  
The nicest fellow in all the town  
But he tipped his hat and sailed away  
And now he's settled in Manitobay.*

**Chorus:**

*One by one, they all clear out,  
Thinking to better themselves, no doubt,  
Caring little how far they go  
From the poor little girls of Ontario.*

**Older Girls:**

*Then Henry Maynard with his white cravat  
His high stiff collar and his new plug hat  
He said if he stayed, he'd have to beg  
And now he's settled in Winnipeg.*

**Chorus:**

*One by one, they all clear out,  
Thinking to better themselves, no doubt,  
Caring little how far they go  
From the poor little girls of Ontario.*

**Older Girls:**

*Then my long-legged druggist with his specs on his nose,  
I really thought that he'd propose  
But he's sold his bottle-shop and now he's gone  
Clear out to little Saskatchewan.*

**Chorus:**

*One by one, they all clear out,  
Thinking to better themselves, no doubt,  
Caring little how far they go  
From the poor little girls of Ontario.*


**Older Girls:**

*I'll pack my clothes in a carpet sack  
I'll go out there and I'll never come back  
I'll find me a husband, and a good one, too  
If I have to go through to Cariboo.*

**Chorus:**

*One by one, they'll all clear out  
Thinking to better themselves, no doubt,  
Caring little how far they go   
From the old, old folks of Ontario.*

 Songs of Ontario", Folkways, 1958)*

*(Harry and Roger come on, in conversation)*

**Harry:** Well, well, old boy. This is a bit sudden.

**Roger:** I've been thinking about it for a while. You know a fresh 
start. Greener pastures.

**Harry:** I see.

**Roger:** This chance came up. Mr. Allin is giving me an
excellent letter of recommendation.

**Harry:** Good, good.  We'll miss you. All your chums. We'll have to
give you a bit of a party for a send off.

**Roger:** Thanks, Harry,  

**Harry:** What about Lydia?

**Roger:**  Lydia will hardly notice I've gone.

**Harry:** Yes, I suppose that's so.

**Roger:** You know, Harry, there is such a thing as being too
agreeable.

**Harry:** Oh. Yes. Sorry, old man.



## Scene Jimmy and the Rotten boys get their comeuppance 


**Lizzie One:** We know, Jimmy Hughes and you Rotten boys.

**Lizzie two:** We know that you made poor Sammy steal that hat.

*(Mrs. Hughes comes out and listens, then gestures for Mrs. Maybee and Mrs. Allin to come out)*

**Mary:** Sammy got the strap. Because you made him do it.

**Jimmy:** So what if we did. What a joke.  Little sniveler. Little snivlers get what they deserve. 

**Mary:** Sniveler yourself. You're afraid of your mother.

**Jimmy:** Ah, says who? I'm not afraid of her nor anyone else neither.
If she tells me to do this, I snap my fingers at her, and if she tells me
to do that I thumb my nose at her. And if she complains then I do
something really rude...

*(Mrs. Hughes comes over and stands behind Jimmy. He does not notice
her)*

**Mrs. Hughes:** And just what would that be, Jimmy my darling, my
heart's delight, the apple of my eye? 

**Jimmy:** *(Turning around)* Mama. I was just joking.


## Scene 

*(Jimmy and the Rotten Boys are dragged by their mothers  up before Mr. Johnston)*

**Mothers:**

*Well Mr. Johnston did you ever see?
Such a lot of rotten boys to cause such misery?
Won't someone tell us where we all went wrong  
And we will put it right again before too very long!*

**Mr. Johnston:** Ladies! Ladies! Er...what is all this?

**Mothers:**

*Well Mr. Johnston we regret to say  
Sammy MacCorquodale has not received fair play!  
These naughty laddies are the rascals that    
Made Sammy go and steal Miss Milroy's hat!*

**Mr. Johnston:**

Boys? Is this true? 

**Mrs. Hughes:**

Isn't that right Jimmy my darling?

**Jimmy:**

Ah...

**Mrs. Hughes:** *(Much louder)*

Isn't that right Jimmy my darling?

**Jimmy:** Yes, it's true. 

**The Mothers:**

*Well Mr. Johnston did you ever see?
Such a lot of rotten boys to cause such misery?
Won't someone tell us where we all went wrong?  
And we will put it right again before too very long!*

**Mr. Johnston:** We certainly will!

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Any sign of Sammy?

**Becky:** No one has seen him. I've looked everywhere,
asked everyone that isn't at the meeting.

**MacCorquodale:** I'm supposed to be at that meeting  right
now.

**Becky:**  The meeting. Yes! Father, we have to ask for help. We have
get the whole town out to look for Sammy. 

*(Becky runs off followed reluctantly by Mr. MacCorquodale.)*


## Scene 

*(Schoolboard meeting)*

**John:** Would anyone else like to speak?

**Man 1** Where is Mr. MacCorquodale.? He ought to speak.

**John:** Clearly he's not here. 

*(Lydia raises her hand)*

**Lydia:** I would like to speak. 


**John:** Yes, Lydia?

**Lydia:** Not long ago I thoughtlessly said  that if I had the vote,
I would not exercise  that right. What a foolish and wicked thing to
say.  What could be more important than to have a say in the way your
country is governed, in the way its laws are made, to have a say in
your children's future?

**John:** Lydia, this is not a meeting about women's suffrage.

**Lydia:** No, but it is a meeting about teachers and teaching. When
Margaret Smith asked  me to distribute those pamphlets... those
pamphlets that so outraged the male population of this town...  it was
like she woke me from a wretched dream to find that the sun was
shining.  

She gave me cause to hope.  That is what teaching can do.  This is
what Margaret  Smith has dedicated her life to doing, for her pupils and
for her community and her country. 

**Roger:** Hear, hear.

*(Some of the men glare at Roger)*

*(Mr. MacCorquodale and Becky come in)*

**John:**
Ah, Mr. MacCorquodale. There you are at last. We were beginning to
give you up.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Neighbours. I need your help. 

**Becky:** We can't find Sammy. We can't find him anywhere.

*(Murmurs of concern)*

**John:** When did you see him last?

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** It's been some hours, isn't that right, Becky?

**Becky:** He goes off sometimes, but not for so long. The sun is
going down.

**John:** We'll organize a search. We'd best form ourselves into
groups. Do we have enough lamps?

**Becky:** We have some at the store.

**Harry:**  We'll come with you.

## Scene 

*(Whole Cast: Song: Searching for Sammy)*

*Where are you Sammy? Sammy MacCorquodale?*
 
**Betsy:** Please God, not the lake.

**Harry:** We'll find him, Betsy. He'll be fine.

**Miss Smith:** Lydia. Do you know where Sammy is?

**Lydia:** Why do you ask me?

**Miss Smith:** Because I think you might know. Where would Sammy
hide?

**Lydia:** I can't betray a trust. 

**Miss Smith:** There is a higher trust, Lydia. Betsy is beside
herself and so is Mr. MacCorquodale. Where is Sammy, Lydia?

**Chorus:**

Where are you Sammy? Sammy MacCorquodale?

**Lydia:** *(To Miss Smith)* All right, Margaret. Come with me.


*(Sammy is found)*

**Lydia:** Sam! Sam, it's Miss Murchison. Are you there?

*(Sam looks, but is silent)*

Sam?

**Sam:** Yes. Don't tell anyone!

**Lydia:** Miss Smith is here. She  knows already.

**Sam:** I'm never going home again. Nobody can make me.

**Lydia:** No one is going to make you. Sam, I'm coming up to talk.
If that's all right.

**Miss Smith:** I'd better find the others.

*(Lydia climbs up to Sammy, and sits beside him.)*

**Lydia:** It's not as much fun in the dark. You can't see anything.

**Sammy:** You can if you look and wait. The moon will be  on the water soon.

**Lydia:** You're right. I can the moonlight now. It's funny, that sunlight is so friendly, and moonlight is so lonesome. 

*(Sammy shrugs)*

It'll probably get cold up here after a while.

**Sammy:** It's summer. It won't get cold. *(Sammy shivers a little)*

**Lydia:** Your father is worried about you.

**Sammy:** He just wants to find me to whip me.

**Lydia:** Betsy is worried about you. 

**Sammy:** I'll send her a letter.

**Lydia:** From wherever you're going.

**Sammy:** *(Nods)* Um hum. Where did Miss Smith go?

**Lydia:** I suppose she went to find your family.

**Sammy:** You promised me you wouldn't tell... about my hiding place.

**Lydia:** This is special, Sam. Serious, you know? We had to find you. 

**Sammy:** Grown up promises are worth about as much as kid promises.

**Lydia:** That's because we're all just people, Sam. 

*(Betsy's voice is heard)*

**Betsy:** Sammy! Sammy! Are you there?

**Sammy:** I don't want to go home.

**Lydia:** You have to go home Sam. They need you.

**Sammy:** I'm not going.

**Miss Smith:** This way, Mr. MacCorquodale. They're up there someplace.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Sammy. Sammy, boy, are you up there? Come down
here right now.

*(John, Harriet, Harry, Roger and other towns people come on)*

**John:** Lydia?

**Lydia:** Yes, Papa?

**John:** Send Sammy down here, right now.

**Lydia:** I can't do that Papa. I can't send him down, any more than
he can send me down. He will do what he wants. Isn't that right, Sam?

**Sammy:** That's right.  And I'm not coming home.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** I'm going up there and bring him down.

**John:**Now don't be daft, MacCorquodale. You'll break your neck.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** When I get a hold you, Sammy, I take the skin off
of you!

**Harriet:** Well, I think we know why Sammy won't go home.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** And I'll thank you Missus to mind your own
business.

**Harriet:** That's Miss... Murchison to you.

**Betsy:** She's right, Father, and don't you tell me to mind my own 
business.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** I'll be pecked to death by women.

**Lydia:** Mr. MacCorquodale. 

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Yes?

**Lydia:** Maybe Sam would come down if you tell him that you love him.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** What?

**Betsy:** You heard her, Father.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** I've never heard of anything so daft. 

**Lydia:** Mr. MacCorquodale! Tell Sam that you love him.

**Harry** *(To Roger)* It could be a long night. Waiting for Hell to freeze over. I mean.

**Roger:** *(Quietly)*  Good for you, Lydia!

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** The whole town's against me. I'm being made a
fool of by a chit of a girl.

**Betsy:** You made a fool of yourself long ago.

*(Betsy turns and runs a little way. Harry stops her, and stands with her to face Mr. MacCorquodale)*

**John:** What have you been doing with your life, MacCorquodale that
your own boy is afraid of you? 

*(Mr. MacCorquodale winces, as if struck, and then walks forward.)*

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Sammy, can you hear me?

**Lydia:** Say yes, Sam.

**Sam:** Yes.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:**  Come down, Sammy. You don't have to be afraid of your old Dad. You have my word.
 I love you Sammy.  Indeed I do. Come down. Let's go home, now.

**Lydia:** I'm coming down first and Sam will follow.

*(Roger runs forward to help Lydia down. Sam follows Lydia down. Betsy and Harry go meet Sammy and bring
him to his father.)*

**MacCorquodale:** I'm sorry, Sammy. You don't have to be afraid of me again. 

**Miss Smith:** Sam, Jimmy Hughes and the Rotten Boys have got their comeuppance.

**Sam:** What does that mean? 

**Miss Smith:** It means they be painting the fence around the school,
and weeding Mrs. Hughes's garden for the rest of the summer. Miss
Milroy is going to get a letter of apology from each of them, and they
have do chores around the town until they can buy her a new hat.  And
if that doesn't reform them we'll think of something else for them to
do.

**Lydia:** And Sam, they won't be bothering you again, right, Mr. Johnston?

**Mr. Johnston:** Not if they know what's good for them.

## Scene 

*(Roger comes along as Lydia is standing out on the porch, looking at
the sky)*

**Roger:** Any shooting stars tonight?

**Lydia:**  *(Smiling)*  Not yet. You're calling at a late hour.
Everyone else is going up to bed.   

**Roger**  I've been out walking. Clearing my poor brain. I just
wandered by on the chance...

**Lydia:** That Harry might still be up?

**Roger:** That you... might be  out looking for shooting stars. 

**Lydia:** I see.

**Roger:** Lydia, I just  wanted to tell how proud I am of you.

**Lydia:**  Proud?... Thank you, Roger.

**Roger:** You've changed a lot in a short time.  Thinking differently about life?

**Lydia:** No more smart answers.  No more easy jokes.  I'm afraid its
going to be a heavy burden. 

**Roger:** What is?

**Lydia:** This believing that things matter, that life matters.

**Roger:** Its not such a heavy burden. Sometimes it feels as light as
air. 

**Lydia:** Perhaps it will  in time.

**Roger:** I also wanted to say goodbye. 

**Lydia:** Goodbye? What do you mean?

**Roger:** I'm going in a couple of days. Out west.  Winnipeg. I have
a job lined up in a bank out there.

**Lydia:** But... You're really going?

**Roger:** I did say...

**Lydia:** But I didn't think you could be serious.

**Roger:** I am serious, sometimes.  Look, if I wrote to you from time
to time, would that be all right?  Not that I'm  an entertaining
correspondent, but...

**Lydia:** I...of course you can write to me. But why are you going?

**Roger:** Oh, I felt like I needed a change. They say the great
North-west is the place for a young man.  There's nothing to tie me
down here. May as well see what it's like out there.

**Lydia:** It's supposed to be cold.

**Roger:** Only in winter and that lasts only half the year.
In any case, I'll dress warmly.

**Lydia:** It's very far away.

**Roger:** 

It is that.

*(Song: The Great Northwest)*

*For a thousand miles to the great North-west a narrow ribbon runs
Through the trackless swamps and the rocks and trees toward the setting sun
And if I take my pen in hand to write the girl that I love the best
Will it reach her from the great North-west, with a thousand miles between us.*

**Lydia:**

*(Sings second verse)*

*In the great North-west I have heard them say the winters there are long, 
That the spring has barely touched the earth when the summer's almost gone.  
And if I take my pen in hand to say at last what is in my heart   
Will it reach him when we are far apart, with a thousand miles between us.*


**Lydia and Roger:**
*For a thousand miles to the great North-west a narrow ribbon runs  
And it winds its way past a thousand lakes toward the setting sun.  
And if I take my pen in hand to write will it reach the one that I love thebest  
With a thousand miles to the great North-west, with a thousand miles between us.*

**Roger:** It's getting late. I'd best be going. I don't know if
I'll see you before I leave. 

**Lydia:** So this is goodbye.

**Roger:** Yes. Goodbye, Lydia.

**Lydia:** Good-bye.

*(Roger walks away. Lydia watches him for a
moment and then runs and catches him around
the waist)*

Roger! Take me with you!

*(Roger and Lydia go off)*


## Scene

*(Chorus and Harriet)*

**First Woman:** What will she have for a wedding dress?

**Harriet:** Just her Sunday best. The one she uses for climbing up
cliffs and such.  We've had a job to make it at all  decent.  I told
her you're twenty-one years old not eleven, and should know better. 

**Second Woman:** What on earth do you mean?

**Harriet:** It's not important. But she's happier than I've seen her in some time.

**First Woman:** You're going to lose her, though.

**Harriet:** Yes. There will be a hole in the family circle. But not for too long I expect.

**Third Woman:** You mean Harry and Betsy.

*(Mr. MacCorquodale comes along)*

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** Good evening, ladies. A delightful evening.

**Second woman:** It'll rain later, like as not.

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** It'll do the gardens good if it does. And
there's nothing more pleasant than to go to sleep with the sound of
rain on the roof. *(He tips his hat to the ladies, smiles and goes
off)*

**Third woman:** Who was that?

**Harriet:** My la. Don't you know Mr. MacCorquodale when you see him?

**Third woman:** I never would have believed it!

## Scene

*(Miss Milroy is sorting through some books and papers)*

**Miss Smith:** They tell me that you are leaving the school.

**Miss Milroy:** For a not unhappy reason. Mr. Johnston has asked
me to marry him.

**Miss Smith:** I have heard a rumour to that effect. I wish you
happiness.

**Miss Milroy:** Thank you.

**Miss Smith:** But I am sorry to see you leave teaching.

**Miss Milroy:** Are you, really? I always felt that...

**Miss Smith:** Felt that what?

**Miss Milroy:** That you had little respect for me.

**Miss Smith:** *(Taken aback.)* You felt that? 

*(Turns away from Miss Milroy and then turns back)*

You make me ashamed of myself.

**Miss Milroy:** Oh, it's natural enough. You have the confidence,
the assurance of youth.

**Miss Smith:** Put it plainly. The arrogance of youth. 

**Miss Milroy:** Perhaps.

**Miss Smith:** Will you not miss your teaching?

**Miss Milroy:** Is it so very important, this teaching?

**Miss Smith:** I cannot conceive of anything more important, or
of any place I would rather be than in the classroom.

**Miss Milroy:** It may not seem possible to you  but

*Once upon a time, not so  long ago,
Only yesterday it seems I was one like you, you know.  
Fresh and newly hatched, still wet with the dew,  
Full of promises of all the things that I would do.*

*But so  weighed down are we, 
By the roles that we must play,  
Though we try to fly,  
Our feet are mired in the clay.*  

*But to discouragement I say*  
*That my courage will not fail.*  
*I will rise and try again,*  
*I will rise and will prevail.*

**Miss Milroy:** Oh I am not so very discouraged. You see, I will
not be giving up teaching entirely. I intend to teach watercolour
painting, to as many as want to learn. Let it be to only one, or
two, but I will teach what I love to those that want to learn.

**Miss Smith:** Give me your hand, Miss Milroy. 

*(They shake hands)*

The very best of luck. I will have to go. Lydia Murchison has asked me
to stand up with her. She's marrying Roger Comfort.

**Miss Milroy:** Is she indeed? I congratulate her. A kind young
man. I wish them happiness.

**Miss Smith:** I will tell her so. Oh, one last thing.  I almost forgot.

*(She goes to the door, and invites someone in and the whole cast
troops on led by Mary and the Two Lizzies carrying a broad straw hat
gaily deck with flowers)*  

**Mr. Johnston:** 
Miss Milroy, that is Annabella, I, we wish to say... 

**Mary and The Two Lizzies:**

Here's a new hat!

**Mr. Johnston:**
Yes. Here is a new hat. I had prepared a speech but since we are
pressed for time, I will take it as read.

**All:** 
Hurray!

**Miss Milroy:** Why are we pressed for time?

**Mr. Johnston:** Miss Murchison is getting married, and cannot be
kept waiting.  Come along everybody. Come along. 

*(All go off)*

## Scene 

*(Final scene. All the cast are at the train station to see Roger and 
Lydia off for Winnipeg)*

**Harriet:** There's the train already. Oh Lord. Where are they?

**John:** I see Roger down with the baggage. The train won't leave for
a few minutes yet.

**Mary:**  Look, there's Lydia, with Miss Smith. 

**Miss Smith:** Well, Mrs. Comfort. You have made your bed and you must lie in it.

**Lydia:** Margaret Smith! What a thing to say!

**Miss Smith:** My word! That was a most unfortunate thing to say.  Am I
blushing?

**Lydia:** Not so that anyone would notice.

**Miss Smith:** It would do me good to blush once in a while. But really...
since you have chosen to be an appendage to a man, I do wish you as much happiness as that situation may offer.

**Lydia:** Thank you, Margaret. *(They shake hands)*

*(Song Miss Smith)*

*Eyes up, chin up, head up sister Lydia  
Youth is the season when great deeds are done,  
In this sad world where many live in darkness  
Some will bring light, and you will be one.*

**Miss Smith:** Will you send me a line or two to let me know how things
are going?

**Lydia:** Yes, certainly I will.

*(John, Harriet and Mary come over to Lydia)*

**Harriet:** Lydia, my dear. *(Kisses Lydia)* I haven't seen you looking
so happy for a long time. Married life is agreeing with you.

**Lydia:** Twenty-four hours is a short time to judge by, but I
think our chances for happiness are better then even.

**John:** A good sense of humour is the best equipment  for
married life, and you both have that.

**Lydia:** And poor Roger will need his more than I will need mine.
Where's Harry?

**Harriet:** He saw Betsy MacCorquodale and was bringing her down
to say good-bye.  I told him not to dawdle.

**Lydia:** There they are. Harry!

**Harry:**  Hey, Lyd. Did you hear us last night?

**Lydia:** Banging your pots and pans? Just barely. It wasn't much of
an effort.

**Harry:** What?

**Lydia:** Still, I suppose I suppose you did your poor best.

**Harry:** Oh for.... You're as bad as Roger.

**Betsy:** All set Lydia?

**Lydia:** The butterflies in my stomach could pick me up and fly me to the great North-West.

**Betsy:** I wish I was going. That is... you know what I mean.

**Harry:** Maybe we'll... that is if we...

**Lydia:** *(Laughing)*  If you...that is,  then we would be very glad
to see you...  both of you.


*(Roger comes hurrying over)*

**Roger:** There you are. This is it, Lydia. Everything is on board.
This is your last chance to chuck it all in. 

**Lydia:** No, dear. *(Laughs)* I will have to get used to saying
that.  I'm looking forward to my great adventure. Farewell to all
things familiar! Bring on the wild beasts and the icy blasts of
winter!

**Roger:** Good-bye, Miss Smith. Bye Harry. Good luck! Miss Murchison,
Mr. Murchison. 

**Miss Smith:** Good luck, Mr. Comfort. 

**Roger:** Thank you Miss Smith. 

*(Mr, MacCorquodale comes on with Sammy.)*

**Lydia:** Oh there's Sam. I have to say good-bye.

**Roger:** We haven't much time.

*(Voice calls "All aboard")*

**Lydia:** *(Runs and shakes Sammy's hand)* Wish me luck, Sam.

**Sammy:** Good Luck Miss Murchison, I wish you weren't going.

**Lydia:** We'll meet again, Sam. Be good. Good-bye everyone,

*(Lydian and Roger run off)*

**Mr. MacCorquodale:** There's always changes Sammy, People come and
go. But we have each other.

*(Mr. MacCorquodale and Sammy go up to Miss Smith)*

Miss Smith. Sammy and me, we were wondering if you had made up your
mind?

**Miss Smith:** Yes, Mr. MacCorquodale. I have.

**Sammy:** And...?

**Miss Smith:** And I'm going to stay. 

*(Final marching dance song)* 

*(The Friendship Wreath)* 

*Winter's blasts are quite forgotten   
Summer time has come again   
Let us now walk out together   
Down the streets and  country lanes.*


*There to call our friends to join us   

*Some pass over some beneath   
circle round in the friendship wreath.*
