# new-play
Materials for the creation of a new musical theatre piece
This project is a dummy created as an exercise in learning how
to use Github.

Github provides you with an editor. I am still almost completely at sea 
with Github.  You store files on the server, as you would on any drive,
I suppose. That is a starting point. But how you use git and so on when you
are writing I don't know. 


In the course of the play it becomes clear that Nancy's father Duncan has 
had an affair while overseas during the war and that the other woman is in
Toronto now and has reconnected with Duncan. Nancy discovers this and 
on the advice of her friend Hannah confronts him.
