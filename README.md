# new-play
Materials for the creation of a new musical theatre piece
This project is a dummy created as an exercise in learning how
to use Github.

Github provides you with an editor. I am still almost completely at sea 
with Github.  You store files on the server, as you would on any drive,
I suppose. That is a starting point. But how you use git and so on when you
are writing I don't know.
